## 1. Practical DL applied to TS notebook collection:
This is the section where we can share the group's notebooks.

### By data type: 
- Univariate:
    - [OliveOil](https://gist.github.com/oguiza/c9c373aec07b96047d1ba484f23b7b47)
- Multivariate datasets:

### By application: 
- TS → images:
    - Unaltered time series:
    - Gramian Angular Field (GAF): 
        - [OliveOil](https://gist.github.com/oguiza/c9c373aec07b96047d1ba484f23b7b47)
    - Wavelet transform: 
- TS → text:
- TS → tabular data:

### By NN model types: 
- CNN models:

## 2. DL applied to TS resources: third party resources
This is the section where we can share useful thrid party resources. 

### Datasets: 
- [UEA & UCR Time Series Classification](http://www.timeseriesclassification.com): contains 128 univariate and 30 multivariate datasets.

### Libraries/ packages:
- [pyts](https://johannfaouzi.github.io/pyts/index.html): is a Python package for time series transformation and classification. It aims to provide state-of-the-art as well as recently published algorithms for time series classification.

### Third party notebooks/ repos:

### Papers:
##### By NN model type:
- CNN models: 


- RNN model:


- Hybrid models: 
    - [LSTM Fully Convolutional Networks for Time Series Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05206)
