## 2. DL applied to TS resources: third party resources
This is the section where we can share useful thrid party resources. 

### Datasets: 
- [UEA & UCR Time Series Classification](http://www.timeseriesclassification.com): contains 128 univariate and 30 multivariate datasets.

### Libraries/ packages:
- [pyts](https://johannfaouzi.github.io/pyts/index.html): is a Python package for time series transformation and classification. It aims to provide state-of-the-art as well as recently published algorithms for time series classification.

### Third party notebooks/ repos:
